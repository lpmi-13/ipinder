# IPinder

- [live site](https://ipinder.netlify.com/)

horrible name, but working on getting a micromaterial to help identify whether
an IP address is public or private.

Basically, I kept forgetting which ranges were private, so I made this to help
myself.

Swipe right if you think it's a public IP address, and swipe left if you think it's
a private IP address. (NOTE: you can just click on desktop screens)

## local development

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

## Deployment

I recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), just since it's super easy and you get
https out of the box
